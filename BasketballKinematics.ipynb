    " Projectile motion is a form of motion experienced by an object or particle (a projectile) that is thrown near the Earth's surface and moves along a curved path under the action of gravity only (in particular, the effects of air resistance are assumed to be negligible). A basketball is a projectile when it is shot. The projectile motion causes the ball to swish through the basket even though you are shooting forward and upwards. \n",

The distance of the hoop from the free throw is about 4.57 m while the distance from the 3 point distance is 724 cm. As we love things to be simple and easier, lets round of the value to 3m, 50 cm, 5m and 700cm.\n",
