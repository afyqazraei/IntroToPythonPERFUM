# Python Code Camp (Semester 2, Year 2019/2020)

These notes were made during Semester 2, Year 2019/2020 for the Python Code Camp classes designed for students who have little experience in programming. The class was supposed to cover more chapters and face-to-face hands-on sessions, but due to COVID-19 the class was unexpectedly cut short due to limitations.
