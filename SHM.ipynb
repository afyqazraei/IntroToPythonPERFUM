    "Simple harmonic motion is a type of the periodic oscillation where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement. It can serve as a mathematical model for a variety of motions, such as the oscillation of a spring. Besides, other phenomena like motion of simple pendulum as well as molecular vibration can be approximated by simple harmonic motion.\n",

    "Today we will look specifically on just the pendulum. As we all know, a pendulum is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force acting on the pendulum causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth.\n",
